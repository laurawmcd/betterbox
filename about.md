Betterbox is a design tool for ethical, effective technologies. It's a collaborative project to gather together all the things we know of that can make technologies _better_.

Betterbox will be a printable card deck with four 'suits' and a set of Major Arcana 'Values' cards which will help to run and inspire discussions about using technology in ways that are ethical and which are more likely to work. It is designed to be used in in-person workshops, but a Mural template will be developed allowing people to use them in a virtual workshop setting. Or you can use the images in the online facilitation space of your choice.

Each card will have a webpage, which shares more information and resources than you can fit on the card. I'm developing the webpages at a rate of about one per week, but contributors are welcome!

You can suggest changes to the cards and to this website [on Github here](https://github.com/laurawmcd/betterbox).
