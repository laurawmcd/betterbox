# Product Owner / Product Manager

The Product Owner or Product Manager card represents the key stakeholder responsible for defining and prioritizing product features, managing the product backlog, and ensuring that the product meets user needs and business objectives.

## Key Considerations

When using this card in your workshop, consider the following aspects:

1. **Vision and Strategy**: How does the product owner align the project with overall business goals and user needs?
2. **Stakeholder Management**: How does the product owner balance the needs of various stakeholders, including users, developers, and business leaders?
3. **Prioritization**: What methods does the product owner use to prioritize features and requirements?
4. **User Advocacy**: How does the product owner ensure that user needs are properly understood and addressed?
5. **Ethical Considerations**: What role does the product owner play in ensuring ethical decision-making throughout the product development process?

Use this card to explore how the product owner's decisions and actions can impact the ethical, practical, and societal implications of the technology being developed.
