# Threat Modeling

The Threat Modeling card represents the process of identifying, communicating, and understanding threats and mitigations within a technology system.

## Key Considerations

1. **Threat Identification**: What are potential threats to the system?
2. **Attack Vectors**: What are possible ways threats could be realized?
3. **Asset Identification**: What assets need to be protected?
4. **Mitigation Strategies**: How can identified threats be mitigated?
5. **Risk Assessment**: How can the likelihood and impact of threats be assessed?

Use this card to systematically identify and address potential security threats to your technology project, enhancing its overall security and resilience.
