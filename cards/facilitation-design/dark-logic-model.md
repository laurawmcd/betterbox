# Dark Logic Model

The Dark Logic Model card encourages consideration of potential negative or unintended consequences of a technology project.

## Key Considerations

1. **Potential Harms**: What are potential negative outcomes of the technology?
2. **Vulnerable Groups**: Who might be particularly vulnerable to negative effects?
3. **Mitigation Strategies**: How can potential negative outcomes be mitigated?
4. **Monitoring**: How can negative outcomes be monitored and detected?
5. **Ethical Implications**: What ethical issues arise when considering potential negative outcomes?

Use this card to proactively identify and address potential negative consequences of your technology project, enhancing its overall positive impact.
