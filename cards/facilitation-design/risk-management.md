# Risk Management

The Risk Management card focuses on the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to a technology project's capital and earnings.

## Key Considerations

1. **Risk Identification**: What are the potential risks that could affect the project?
2. **Risk Assessment**: How can the likelihood and potential impact of each risk be evaluated?
3. **Risk Mitigation**: What strategies can be implemented to reduce or manage identified risks?
4. **Contingency Planning**: What backup plans can be put in place for high-impact risks?
5. **Monitoring and Review**: How will risks be continuously monitored and managed throughout the project lifecycle?

Use this card to develop a comprehensive risk management strategy for your technology project, ensuring that potential issues are anticipated and addressed proactively.
