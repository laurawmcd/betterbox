# System Mapping

The System Mapping card represents the process of creating visual representations of complex systems and their interactions.

## Key Considerations

1. **System Components**: What are the key components of the system?
2. **Relationships**: How do different components of the system interact?
3. **Boundaries**: What are the boundaries of the system being mapped?
4. **Inputs and Outputs**: What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
5. **Feedback Loops**: Are there any important feedback loops within the system?

Use this card to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system your technology operates within, identifying key relationships and potential areas for intervention or improvement.
