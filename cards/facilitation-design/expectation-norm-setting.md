## Key Considerations

1. **Project Goals**: How can you clearly communicate the project's goals and objectives?
2. **Team Dynamics**: What norms should be established for team interaction and collaboration?
3. **Communication**: What expectations should be set for communication within the project?
4. **Ethics**: How can ethical norms be established and maintained throughout the project?
5. **Accountability**: How will team members be held accountable for meeting expectations?

Use this card to ensure that all participants have a clear understanding of project goals, expectations, and norms of behavior, fostering a productive and positive project environment.
