# Risk Analysis

The Risk Analysis card represents the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks in a technology project.

## Key Considerations

1. **Risk Identification**: What are the potential risks associated with the project?
2. **Risk Assessment**: How can the likelihood and impact of each risk be evaluated?
3. **Risk Mitigation**: What strategies can be employed to minimize or manage identified risks?
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: How can risks be continuously monitored throughout the project lifecycle?
5. **Ethical Implications**: Are there any ethical risks that need to be considered?

Use this card to ensure that potential risks are thoroughly considered and managed throughout the development process.
