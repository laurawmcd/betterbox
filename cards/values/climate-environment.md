# Climate and Environment

This card focuses on the environmental implications of technology development and use.

## Key Considerations

1. **Energy Efficiency**: How can the technology be designed to minimize energy consumption?
2. **Resource Use**: What resources are required for the technology and how can their use be optimized?
3. **E-Waste**: How is the end-of-life disposal or recycling of the technology addressed?
4. **Carbon Footprint**: What is the carbon footprint of the technology throughout its lifecycle?
5. **Environmental Benefits**: Can the technology contribute positively to environmental conservation or climate change mitigation?

Use this card to ensure your technology project considers and minimizes its environmental impact, and potentially contributes to environmental sustainability.
