2. **Access and Equity**: How can the technology promote more equitable access to resources or opportunities?
3. **Social Justice**: How can the technology contribute to social justice goals?
4. **Marginalized Groups**: How might the technology impact marginalized or vulnerable groups?
5. **Accountability**: How can those with power in the project be held accountable for its impacts?
