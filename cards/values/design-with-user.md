# Design with the User

This card emphasizes the importance of involving users throughout the design and development process.

## Key Considerations

1. **User Research**: How are user needs and preferences being researched and understood?
2. **Co-Design**: How are users involved in the design process?
3. **Usability Testing**: How is the technology tested with actual users?
4. **Feedback Loops**: How is user feedback collected and incorporated into ongoing development?
5. **User Empowerment**: How does the technology empower users and respect their agency?

Use this card to ensure your technology project truly meets user needs and provides a positive user experience.
