# Understand the Existing Ecosystem

This card focuses on the importance of understanding the broader context in which a technology will be implemented and used.

## Key Considerations

1. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Who are all the stakeholders affected by or involved in the technology?
2. **Existing Solutions**: What solutions already exist in this space and how does this technology relate to them?
3. **Cultural Context**: How does the local cultural context influence the use and impact of the technology?
4. **Infrastructure**: What existing infrastructure does the technology need to work with or around?
5. **Policy Environment**: What policies or regulations might affect the implementation or use of the technology?

Use this card to ensure your technology project is well-integrated into its broader ecosystem and context.
