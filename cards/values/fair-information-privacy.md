# Fair Information and Privacy Practices

This card focuses on the ethical collection, use, and protection of personal information in technology projects.

## Key Considerations

1. **Data Collection**: What personal information is collected and is it necessary?
2. **Informed Consent**: How is user consent obtained for data collection and use?
3. **Data Use**: How is collected data used and is this use transparent to users?
4. **Data Protection**: What measures are in place to protect user data?
5. **User Control**: How much control do users have over their personal information?

Use this card to ensure your technology project respects user privacy and handles personal information ethically and responsibly.
