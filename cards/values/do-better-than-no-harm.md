# Do Better Than No Harm

This card emphasizes the principle that technology should not only avoid causing harm but actively strive to create positive impact.

## Key Considerations

1. **Impact Assessment**: How can the potential positive and negative impacts of the technology be assessed?
2. **Unintended Consequences**: How can unintended negative consequences be anticipated and mitigated?
3. **Positive Outcomes**: What specific positive outcomes does the technology aim to achieve?
4. **Measurement**: How will the actual impact of the technology be measured and evaluated?
5. **Continuous Improvement**: How can the technology be iteratively improved to increase its positive impact?

Use this card to ensure your technology project goes beyond simply avoiding harm and actively contributes to positive change.
