# Reuse and Improve

This card focuses on the principle of building on existing resources rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Key Considerations

1. **Existing Solutions**: What existing solutions or components can be reused or adapted?
2. **Lessons Learned**: What can be learned from similar projects or previous iterations?
3. **Improvement Opportunities**: How can existing solutions be improved upon?
4. **Collaboration**: How can collaboration with other projects or organizations enable reuse and improvement?
5. **Documentation**: How can improvements and adaptations be documented to benefit future projects?

Use this card to promote efficiency, learning, and continuous improvement in your technology project.
