# End User 1

The End User 1 card represents the primary users of the technology being developed. These are the individuals who will directly interact with and benefit from the product or service.

## Key Considerations

When using this card in your workshop, consider the following aspects:

1. **User Needs**: What are the primary needs and goals of this user group?
2. **User Experience**: How can the technology be designed to provide the best possible experience for these users?
3. **Accessibility**: Are there any specific accessibility requirements for this user group?
4. **User Feedback**: How can feedback from this user group be effectively collected and incorporated into the development process?
5. **Potential Impacts**: How might the technology positively or negatively affect this user group's daily life or work?

Use this card to ensure that the primary end users' perspectives are central to the development process and that their needs are being met in an ethical and effective manner.
