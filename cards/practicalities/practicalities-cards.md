# Design for Scale

The Design for Scale card represents the approach of creating solutions that can effectively grow and adapt to serve larger numbers of users or handle increased demands.

## Key Considerations

When using this card in your workshop, consider the following aspects:

1. **Architecture**: How can the system architecture be designed to support scaling?
2. **Performance**: What performance considerations need to be addressed for large-scale use?
3. **Data Management**: How will data storage and processing scale with increased usage?
4. **User Experience**: How can the user experience remain consistent as the system scales?
5. **Resource Planning**: What resources (technical, human, financial) are needed to support scaling?

Use this card to ensure that scalability is considered from the early stages of development, allowing for future growth and adaptation.

# Political Context

The Political Context card represents the consideration of the political environment in which a technology project operates.

## Key Considerations

When using this card in your workshop, consider the following aspects:

1. **Regulatory Landscape**: What are the relevant laws and regulations affecting the project?
2. **Stakeholder Interests**: How do different political stakeholders view or influence the project?
3. **Public Perception**: How might the political context affect public perception of the technology?
4. **Ethics and Governance**: How can the project navigate ethical issues in the given political context?
5. **Long-term Sustainability**: How might changes in the political landscape affect the project's long-term viability?

Use this card to ensure that political factors are considered in project planning and decision-making, helping to navigate potential challenges and opportunities.
