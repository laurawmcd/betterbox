# Infrastructure, Regulation and Market

This card focuses on the broader context in which a technology solution will be implemented, including infrastructure limitations, regulatory requirements, and market dynamics.

## Key Considerations

1. **Infrastructure Limitations**: What infrastructure constraints might affect the technology's implementation or use?
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: What regulations must the technology comply with, and how?
3. **Market Demand**: Is there a clear market demand for the technology?
4. **Competition**: How does the technology position itself in relation to existing market offerings?
5. **Future Trends**: What future infrastructure, regulatory, or market trends might impact the technology?

Use this card to ensure your technology solution is viable within its broader context, complying with regulations and meeting market needs while working within infrastructure constraints.
