# Political Context

The Political Context card represents the consideration of the political environment in which a technology project operates.

## Key Considerations

1. **Regulatory Landscape**: What are the relevant laws and regulations affecting the project?
2. **Stakeholder Interests**: How do different political stakeholders view or influence the project?
3. **Public Perception**: How might the political context affect public perception of the technology?
4. **Ethics and Governance**: How can the project navigate ethical issues in the given political context?
5. **Long-term Sustainability**: How might changes in the political landscape affect the project's long-term viability?

Use this card to ensure that political factors are considered in project planning and decision-making, helping to navigate potential challenges and opportunities.
