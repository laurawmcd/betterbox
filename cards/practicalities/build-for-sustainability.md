2. **Maintenance**: What ongoing maintenance will be required, and how will it be managed?
3. **Adaptability**: How can the technology be designed to adapt to changing needs over time?
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: How will knowledge about the system be preserved and transferred?
5. **Environmental Impact**: What is the long-term environmental impact of the technology?

Use this card to plan for the long-term sustainability of your technology project, ensuring it continues to provide value well into the future.
