# Implementing Organization Capacity

This card focuses on the ability of an organization to effectively implement and maintain a technology solution.

## Key Considerations

1. **Skills and Expertise**: What skills and expertise are required to implement and maintain the technology?
2. **Resource Availability**: Does the organization have the necessary resources (human, financial, technical) to support the technology?
3. **Training Needs**: What training might be required for staff to effectively use and manage the technology?
4. **Organizational Culture**: How does the organizational culture support or hinder technology adoption?
5. **Change Management**: What change management processes are needed to support successful implementation?

Use this card to assess and plan for the organizational capacity needed to successfully implement and sustain your technology project.
