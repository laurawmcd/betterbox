# Language, Literacy

The Language, Literacy card represents the consideration of linguistic diversity and varying literacy levels among users of technology.

## Key Considerations

1. **Multilingual Support**: How can the technology support multiple languages effectively?
2. **Literacy Levels**: How can the interface be designed to accommodate users with different literacy levels?
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: How can language use be culturally appropriate and sensitive?
4. **Accessibility**: How can language and literacy considerations be integrated with accessibility features?
5. **User Testing**: How can you test the effectiveness of your language and literacy accommodations?

Use this card to ensure that your technology is inclusive and accessible to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds and with varying literacy levels.
