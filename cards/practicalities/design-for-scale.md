# Design for Scale

The Design for Scale card represents the approach of creating solutions that can effectively grow and adapt to serve larger numbers of users or handle increased demands.

## Key Considerations

1. **Architecture**: How can the system architecture be designed to support scaling?
2. **Performance**: What performance considerations need to be addressed for large-scale use?
3. **Data Management**: How will data storage and processing scale with increased usage?
4. **User Experience**: How can the user experience remain consistent as the system scales?
5. **Resource Planning**: What resources (technical, human, financial) are needed to support scaling?

Use this card to ensure that scalability is considered from the early stages of development, allowing for future growth and adaptation.
