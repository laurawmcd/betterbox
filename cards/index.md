# Betterbox Cards

Our deck consists of four suits of 13 cards each, plus a Values Major Arcana of 22 cards. Each section helps you explore different aspects of ethical technology development.

## Card Suits

### [Users]({{ site.baseurl }}/cards/users/)
Cards representing various stakeholders in technology projects, from direct users to regulatory bodies. Use these cards to identify and consider the needs, perspectives, and interests of different people who interact with or are affected by your technology.

### [Practicalities]({{ site.baseurl }}/cards/practicalities/)
Cards addressing real-world considerations that impact technology implementation, from organizational capacity to infrastructure requirements. These cards help you think through the practical challenges and requirements for successful deployment.

### [Non-functional Requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/cards/non-functional-requirements/)
Technical considerations beyond basic functionality, including accessibility, security, and performance requirements. Use these cards to ensure your technology is robust, secure, and meets quality standards.

### [Exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/cards/facilitation-design/)
Tools and techniques for workshop facilitation and design thinking. These cards provide methods and approaches for running effective workshops and design sessions.

## Values Major Arcana

### [Values]({{ site.baseurl }}/cards/values/)
A special set of cards focusing on ethical principles and values that should guide technology development. These cards help ensure ethical considerations and human values are central to your development process.

## Using the Cards

Some cards are intentionally left blank for your own ideas. You can use the cards in various ways:
- As part of structured exercises
- Shuffled and dealt to workshop participants as inspiration
- For individual exploration and reflection
- To guide group discussions about technology development
- To prompt creative thinking about ethical implications

Get creative with how you use them - though we don't recommend using them for fortune telling!
