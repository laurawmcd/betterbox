# Regulator

The Regulator card represents government bodies or agencies that oversee and enforce rules in the relevant industry or technological domain.

## Key Considerations

1. **Compliance**: What regulations must the project comply with?
2. **Data Protection**: How does the project ensure compliance with data protection regulations?
3. **Ethical Standards**: What ethical standards do regulators expect the project to uphold?
4. **Reporting**: What kind of reporting or documentation do regulators require?
5. **Future Regulations**: How can the project anticipate and prepare for potential future regulations?

Use this card to ensure that regulatory requirements and ethical standards are properly considered and integrated into the technology development process.
