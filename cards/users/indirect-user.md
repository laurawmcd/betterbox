# Indirect User

The Indirect User card represents individuals or groups who may not directly use the technology but are affected by its implementation or outcomes.

## Key Considerations

1. **Identification**: Who are the indirect users of the technology?
2. **Impact Assessment**: How might the technology affect these indirect users?
3. **Ethical Considerations**: What ethical issues arise when considering indirect users?
4. **Unintended Consequences**: What potential unintended consequences might affect indirect users?
5. **Inclusion**: How can the needs and perspectives of indirect users be included in the design process?

Use this card to broaden the consideration of the technology's impact beyond direct users, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of its societal implications.
