# Funder

The Funder card represents individuals or organizations that provide financial support for technology projects.

## Key Considerations

1. **Project Goals**: How do the funder's goals align with the project's objectives?
2. **Return on Investment**: What does the funder expect in terms of ROI?
3. **Risk Assessment**: How does the funder evaluate and mitigate project risks?
4. **Ethical Considerations**: How can funders ensure their investments support ethical technology development?
5. **Long-term Impact**: How does the funder consider the long-term societal impact of the project?

Use this card to explore how funders' priorities and decisions can shape the direction and impact of technology projects.
