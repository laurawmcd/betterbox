# End User 3

The End User 3 card represents tertiary user groups who may interact with the technology less frequently or in unique ways.

## Key Considerations

1. **Occasional Use**: How can the system accommodate users who interact with it infrequently?
2. **Specialized Needs**: Are there any specialized features required for this user group?
3. **Intuitiveness**: How can the interface be made intuitive for infrequent users?
4. **Support**: What kind of support structures are needed for this user group?
5. **Impact Assessment**: How might the technology impact this group indirectly?

Use this card to ensure that the needs of all potential user groups, even those with less frequent interactions, are considered in the development process.
