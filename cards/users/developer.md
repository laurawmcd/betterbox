# Developer

The Developer card represents the technical professionals responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.

## Key Considerations

1. **Technical Expertise**: How does the developer's knowledge and skills influence project decisions and outcomes?
2. **Ethical Coding Practices**: How can developers ensure they're writing code that is ethical, secure, and respects user privacy?
3. **Collaboration**: How do developers work with other team members, such as designers and product managers?
4. **Problem-Solving**: What role do developers play in identifying and solving technical challenges?
5. **Continuous Learning**: How do developers stay updated with new technologies and best practices?

Use this card to explore how developers' decisions and actions can impact the ethical, practical, and societal implications of the technology being developed.
