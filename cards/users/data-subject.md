# Data Subject

The Data Subject card represents individuals whose personal data is collected, held, or processed by the technology.

## Key Considerations

1. **Data Rights**: What rights do data subjects have regarding their personal data?
2. **Consent**: How is consent obtained and managed for data processing?
3. **Data Access**: How can data subjects access their personal data?
4. **Data Correction**: How can data subjects correct inaccurate personal data?
5. **Data Deletion**: What processes are in place for data subjects to request data deletion?

Use this card to ensure that the rights and needs of data subjects are respected and protected throughout the data lifecycle in your technology project.
