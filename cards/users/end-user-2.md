# End User 2

The End User 2 card represents secondary user groups who interact with the technology but may have different needs or use patterns compared to primary users.

## Key Considerations

1. **Unique Needs**: How do this group's needs differ from primary users?
2. **Usage Patterns**: How might this group's usage patterns differ?
3. **Accessibility**: Are there specific accessibility considerations for this group?
4. **Training**: What kind of training or support might this group need?
5. **Feedback**: How can you gather and incorporate feedback from this user group?

Use this card to ensure that the needs of secondary user groups are also considered in the development process, promoting inclusivity and broader usability of the technology.
