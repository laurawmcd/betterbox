# General Public

The General Public card represents the broader society that may be impacted by the technology, even if they don't use it directly.

## Key Considerations

1. **Societal Impact**: How might the technology affect society at large?
2. **Public Perception**: How might the public perceive and react to the technology?
3. **Ethical Implications**: What ethical considerations arise when considering the general public?
4. **Information and Transparency**: How can the project maintain transparency with the public?
5. **Long-term Consequences**: What potential long-term effects might the technology have on society?

Use this card to consider the broader societal implications of the technology, ensuring that its development takes into account the interests and well-being of the general public.
