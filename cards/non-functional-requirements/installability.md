# Installability

The Installability card focuses on the ease with which the technology system can be installed and made ready for use.

## Key Considerations

1. **Installation Process**: How can the installation process be simplified and streamlined?
2. **System Requirements**: What are the minimum system requirements for installation?
3. **Dependencies**: How are dependencies managed during the installation process?
4. **Error Handling**: How are errors during installation handled and communicated to users?
5. **Uninstallation**: How can the system be cleanly and completely uninstalled if needed?

Use this card to ensure that your technology can be easily and reliably installed by its intended users or administrators.
