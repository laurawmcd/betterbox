# Security

The Security card represents the measures taken to protect technology systems and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

## Key Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: How are users' identities verified and their access rights managed?
2. **Data Encryption**: How is sensitive data protected both in transit and at rest?
3. **Threat Modeling**: What potential security threats does the system face and how are they mitigated?
4. **Security Testing**: What methods are used to test and verify the system's security?
5. **Incident Response**: What procedures are in place to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents?

Use this card to ensure that security is comprehensively addressed in your technology project, protecting both the system and its users.
