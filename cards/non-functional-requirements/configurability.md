# Configurability

The Configurability card represents the ability for users or administrators to modify aspects of the system's operation without requiring changes to the source code.

## Key Considerations

1. **User-Configurable Elements**: What aspects of the system should users be able to configure?
2. **Configuration Interfaces**: How will users interact with configuration options?
3. **Default Settings**: What are appropriate default configurations?
4. **Configuration Management**: How will different configurations be managed and versioned?
5. **Impact on Performance**: How might different configurations affect system performance?

Use this card to ensure your technology provides appropriate levels of configurability, allowing it to be adapted to different use cases and user preferences.
