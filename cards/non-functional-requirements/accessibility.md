# Accessibility

The Accessibility card represents the practice of designing technology that can be used by people with various disabilities or impairments.

## Key Considerations

1. **Visual Accessibility**: How can the technology accommodate users with visual impairments?
2. **Auditory Accessibility**: How can the technology accommodate users with hearing impairments?
3. **Motor Accessibility**: How can the technology accommodate users with motor impairments?
4. **Cognitive Accessibility**: How can the technology accommodate users with cognitive impairments?
5. **Standards Compliance**: How can the technology adhere to accessibility standards and guidelines (e.g., WCAG)?

Use this card to ensure that your technology is inclusive and usable by as wide a range of users as possible, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
