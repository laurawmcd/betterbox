# Legal

The Legal card focuses on ensuring that the technology project complies with relevant laws and regulations.

## Key Considerations

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: What laws and regulations must the technology comply with?
2. **Intellectual Property**: How are intellectual property rights managed and protected?
3. **User Agreements**: What terms of service or user agreements are necessary?
4. **Data Protection**: How does the technology comply with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR)?
5. **Liability**: What potential liabilities exist and how are they mitigated?

Use this card to ensure your technology project operates within legal boundaries and manages legal risks effectively.
