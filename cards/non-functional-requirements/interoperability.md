# Interoperability

The Interoperability card focuses on the ability of a technology system to exchange and make use of information with other systems.

## Key Considerations

1. **Standards Compliance**: What industry standards should the system adhere to for interoperability?
2. **Data Formats**: What data formats will be used for information exchange?
3. **APIs**: What APIs will be provided or consumed to enable interoperability?
4. **Integration Testing**: How will interoperability with other systems be tested?
5. **Future Compatibility**: How can the system be designed to maintain interoperability as technologies evolve?

Use this card to ensure your technology can effectively communicate and work with other systems, enhancing its utility and longevity.
