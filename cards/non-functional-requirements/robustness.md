# Robustness

The Robustness card focuses on the ability of a technology system to handle errors, unexpected inputs, and varying operational conditions without failing.

## Key Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: How does the system handle and recover from errors?
2. **Input Validation**: How are invalid or unexpected inputs handled?
3. **Fault Tolerance**: How does the system continue functioning in the event of component failures?
4. **Graceful Degradation**: How can the system maintain core functionality even when some features are unavailable?
5. **Stress Testing**: How is the system tested under extreme conditions to ensure robustness?

Use this card to ensure your technology can reliably perform under a wide range of conditions and scenarios.
