# Localization

The Localization card focuses on adapting technology to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target market or locale.

## Key Considerations

1. **Language Support**: How can the technology support multiple languages, including right-to-left scripts if necessary?
2. **Cultural Adaptation**: How can cultural nuances be respected in the user interface and content?
3. **Date, Time, and Number Formats**: How can the system adapt to different formats used across locales?
4. **Legal Requirements**: Are there specific legal requirements in target locales that need to be addressed?
5. **Scalability**: How can the localization process be designed to easily add new languages or locales in the future?

Use this card to ensure your technology can be effectively adapted for use in different linguistic and cultural contexts.
