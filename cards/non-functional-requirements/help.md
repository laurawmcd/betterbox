# Help

The Help card focuses on providing users with the information and assistance they need to effectively use the technology.

## Key Considerations

1. **Help Documentation**: What type of help documentation should be provided (e.g., user manuals, FAQs, tutorials)?
2. **Contextual Help**: How can help be provided within the context of specific tasks or features?
3. **Search Functionality**: How can users easily find the help information they need?
4. **Multilingual Support**: How will help be provided for users of different languages?
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: How can users provide feedback on the helpfulness of the assistance provided?

Use this card to ensure that your technology provides effective, accessible, and user-friendly help and support to its users.
