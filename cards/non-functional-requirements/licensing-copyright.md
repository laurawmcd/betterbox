# Licensing & Copyright

The Licensing & Copyright card focuses on managing the rights to use, distribute, and modify the technology and its components.

## Key Considerations

1. **Software Licenses**: What licenses are used for the project and its dependencies?
2. **Open Source Compliance**: How is compliance with open source licenses ensured?
3. **Copyright Notices**: How are copyright notices displayed and maintained?
4. **User-Generated Content**: How are copyrights for user-generated content managed?
5. **License Compatibility**: How is compatibility between different licenses ensured?

Use this card to ensure that your technology project properly manages licensing and copyright issues, respecting intellectual property rights and complying with license terms.
