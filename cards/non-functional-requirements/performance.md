# Performance

The Performance card represents the consideration of how well a system performs in terms of responsiveness, speed, and resource utilization.

## Key Considerations

1. **Response Time**: What are the acceptable response times for different operations?
2. **Throughput**: How many operations per unit of time should the system be able to handle?
3. **Resource Utilization**: How efficiently does the system use CPU, memory, network, and other resources?
4. **Scalability**: How does performance change as the load on the system increases?
5. **Performance Testing**: What methods will be used to measure and monitor performance?

Use this card to ensure that performance requirements are clearly defined and met, contributing to a positive user experience and efficient system operation.
