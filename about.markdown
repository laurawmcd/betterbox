Betterbox is a design tool for ethical, effective technologies.

It is a printable card deck with four 'suits' and a set of Major Arcana 'Values' cards which will help to run and inspire discussions about using technology in ways that are ethical and which are more likely to work.

It is designed to be used in in-person workshops, but a Mural template exists to use them in a virtual workshop setting.

You can suggest changes to the cards and to this website [on Github here](https://github.com/laurawmcd/betterbox).

Betterbox is a side project by [Laura Walker McDonald](http://www.laurawalkermcdonald.com).
