Betterbox is a deck of cards designed to help people run workshops that explore the ethical, practical, and societal implications of technology. Our cards are organized into five suits:

1. [Users](/cards/users/)
2. [Facilitation/Design Exercises](/cards/facilitation-design/)
3. [Practicalities](/cards/practicalities/)
4. [Non-functional Requirements](/cards/non-functional-requirements/)
5. [Values](/cards/values/)

Each suit contains 13 cards, with some left blank for your own ideas. Explore each suit to learn more about the specific cards and how they can help in your workshops.
