# Betterbox

Betterbox is a deck of cards designed to help people run workshops to think through ethical, practical, and societal implications of technology. The cards can be used to facilitate discussions and drive innovative thinking in your technology projects.

## About

The Betterbox deck consists of four suits, each containing 13 cards, and one 'Values' Major Arcana containing 22 cards:

1. **Users**: Cards representing various stakeholders in technology projects, from direct users to regulatory bodies.
2. **Facilitation/Design Exercises**: Tools and techniques for workshop facilitation and design thinking.
3. **Practicalities**: Cards addressing real-world considerations that impact technology implementation.
4. **Non-functional Requirements**: Technical considerations beyond basic functionality.

The card sizes and the structure of the deck are based on Tarot decks, and you can have some fun experimenting with Tarot spreads to inspire your thinking about the project! But for now, there's nothing that maps the cards to traditional Tarot card decks on an individual basis, so I wouldn't make any personal life decisions based on your readings.

## Using Betterbox

The cards can be used in various workshop settings to:
- Ground your practice in your Values
- Identify key stakeholders and their needs
- Plan and facilitate design thinking sessions
- Consider practical implementation challenges
- Address technical requirements systematically
- Ensure ethical considerations are integrated into technology development
